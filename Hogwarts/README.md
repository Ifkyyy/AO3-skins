# Hogwarts Houses
Here are site skins for the four Hogwarts houses: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. 

The `desktop` file is always necessary, and then `mobile` and `tablet` are optional. However, I recommend just using all three any way, so there will never be any problems in future.

The `mobile` and `tablet` files are the same for each house (layout changes only), and then the `desktop` files are different due to difference in colours and icons.

## Preview
Look in the [images](https://github.com/Ifkyyy/AO3-skins/tree/main/Hogwarts/images) folder to see screenshots using the skins. The file name specifies which skin is in use for each image. 

Some skins may have less screenshots than the others, due to only the changes being in the colour scheme.
