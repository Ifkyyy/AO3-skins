# Hogwarts Houses
Here are site skins for the four Hogwarts houses: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. 

The `desktop` file is always necessary, and `mobile` and `tablet` are optional. However, I recommend just using all three any way, so there will never be any problems in future. 

The `mobile` and `tablet` files are the same for each house (layout changes only), and then the `desktop` files are different due to difference in colours and icons. 

**_So if you wish to have multiple of the Hogwarts houses skins, you can reuse `mobile` and `tablet`. Only create each once, and add them as parent to each `desktop` file._** 

## Preview
Look in the [_images](https://github.com/Ifkyyy/AO3-skins/tree/main/Hogwarts/_images) folder to see screenshots using the skins. The file name specifies which skin is in use for each image. 

Some skins may have less screenshots than the others, due to only the changes being in the colour scheme.
